These often represent a physical sensor or motor, but they also apply to anything you would write a <code>Class</code> or <code>Object</code> for.</p> <p>To communicate between nodes, ROS uses topics. This is essentially like a group chat where nodes can talk on  or listen to messages from other nodes. To speak on a topic, you create a publisher. Then, you can write whatever messages you want to a topic. To listen to a topic, you create a subscriber. Any messages that are published onto a topic are broadcasted to ALL subscribers listening on that topic. It's important that each topic uses a single standard message type, like a String, Float32, or a custom message type you define.</p> <p>Whenever a message is broadcasted, the subscribers will run a callback function. A callback function is just  a function that is executed whenever a specific event happens. For example, pressing the 'A' key on a keyboard might run  <code>a_pressed_callback()</code>, which would execute whatever code is defined in the function. ROS also uses callbacks for when  a certain time has passed, called timers. This is useful for setting up sensors to publish data every so often.</p> <p>Contextualizing ROS:</p> <ul> <li>Each Node is like a user</li> <li>All Nodes can join specfic 'group chats' called topics, which are identified by a topic name like \"/sensors/windvane/angle\"</li> <li>Nodes can send and receive messages on that topic, following the same language as defined in the message type</li> <li>Whenever a message is received by a Node, it executes a defined callback function</li> </ul>"},{"location":"docs/Code%20Overview/#sensorscontrols","title":"Sensors/Controls","text":"<p>Scripts which interface with the mechanical parts of the boat.
