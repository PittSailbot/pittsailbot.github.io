## How to Sail
![Sailing Diagram](assets/Sailing%20Diagram.png)

## TLDR

- Boat can't sail straight upwind, so you must sail diagonally and swap sides to zig-zag where you want to go

**When tacking (upwind)**:

- Sail all the way in
- Rudder left/right

**When downind**:

- Sail out
